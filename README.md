Material for a session on Qualitative Data in Public Engagement during the Policy Community Conference, on February 20, 2019.

# How Can We Make Sense of Qualitative Data? Some Insight through Public Engagement
Beyond broad principles and well-known methods, the practice of policymaking requires deep insight from the public. Consultations and other forms of engagement may provide an avenue to develop such insight but only if we are able to make sense of the data they produce. This interactive session encourages participants to work through issues surrounding the collection, management, and analysis of qualitative data using examples from public engagement in the policy lifecycle.

# Shared Dataset
During this workshop, we are using a dataset on Flexible Work Arrangements (FWAs) shared by ESDC [on the Open Government Portal](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/47a06948-c462-4c7e-9f0f-2fab1e9e29df). The original dataset is bilingual and contains some data that we don’t need. Extracts from this dataset will be available in this repository.

# PE CoP: The Public Engagement Community of Practice
